<p>Today I have read the book "Show Your Work" by Austin Kleon,
the very same author who brought us "Steal Like an Artist". 
Following the tradition of his previous book, 
the author serves us nuggets of advices,
One of them that particularly 
resonates with me is: 
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Become a documentarian of what you do.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
In the context of exposing yourself to the world, 
which is the theme of this book, 
the documentation of your working process serves 2 purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>By far it is a superior way to showcase your work
   and your contributions than a traditional resume.
</li>
<li>It is also the source of materials that you want to share
   with the world in order to be known. 
</li>
</ul>


<p>
However in this blog post, I am going to focus on its role
in self development, in improving ourselves in general.
</p>
<p>
It is not a secret that writing down our though 
will help us to think clearer. Genius like 
Leornado Da Vinci left behind tons of notebooks,
full of his casual observations, beautiful sketches,
riddles, meditations and a wide range of other writings.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps none other than a genius of our time, 
Prof. Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, a famous computer scientist, 
can illustrate the point better. 
In the video interview entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL97C8C53ZM">Discipline in Thought</a>,
he mentioned his daily discipline of 
writing down clearly his thoughts, 
which lead to hundreds of scientific papers 
archived in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">EWD Archieve</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you 
can write, even more when you can teach, but certain 
when you can program.
</p>
<p>
~ Alan Perlis
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Writing things down forces us to reflect on our thinking process,
encourages us to refine our logical arguments, 
and to further consider some subtleties which
we might miss on the first occasion. 
But perhaps more importantly, writing allows us 
to look at our thought more objectively because 
now it is out there, on a piece of paper, not 
inside our head. The new gain objectivity thus allows
us to refine our idea further. 
Take programming as an example, writing down a program 
require us to gain a fairly good understanding of a problem, 
and by refactoring the program our understanding goes
even deeper. Notice that our understanding is spiraling up,
as a effect of constant writing and refactoring.
</p>
<p>
We can observe the same pattern in many other different areas.
For example, internal emotional mastery begin with 
noticing the inner experiences and to be able to 
articulate them in such a way to gain some conscious 
control over them.     
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Become aware of internal, subjective sub-verbal experiences, 
so that these experiences can be brought into the
world of abstraction, of conversation, of naming, etc.,
with the consequence of that it immediately becomes possible
for a certain amount of control to be exerted
over these hither unconscious and uncontrollable processes.
</p>
<p>
~ Abraham Maslow
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This is what education is all about: to be able
to learn, unlearn, and relearn; 
to break down our old understanding and
build up a new understanding;
to refactor our thinking.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I would define intellectual elegance
as a mind that is continually refine
itself with education and knowledge.
</p>
<p>
~ Massimo Vignelli
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
In general, this is how we improve our life.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At every moment, step by step, 
one must confront what one is thinking and what one is doing,
with what one is.
</p>
<p>
~ Michel Foucalt
